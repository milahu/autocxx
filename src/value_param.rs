/// A trait which is used to receive any C++ parameter passed by value.
/// This trait is implemented both for references `&T` and for `UniquePtr<T>`,
/// subject to the presence or absence of suitable copy and move constructors.
/// This allows you to pass in parameters by copy (as is ergonomic and normal
/// in C++) retaining the original parameter; or by move semantics thus
/// destroying the object you're passing in. Simply use a reference if you want
/// copy semantics, or the item itself if you want move semantics.
/// It is not recommended that you implement this trait.
